####Create ExtJS prototype applications easier and faster.

Do you need a skeleton application or a prototype written in ExtJS? Just create it with easily understandable specification.

##**Getting Started**

Before you start it, please check the [requirements](#requirements)!

 1.  Install gui-tool with npm in console.
      
      `npm install gui-tool -g`
 
 
 2. Create a new gui-tool project. If you use the `name` optional variable, the root directory will be also created with the given name. Otherwise you need to create a directory and run the command inside. The tool will download the ExtJS framework (4.2.1 gpl) into the `<project_name>/webui` directory.
 
     `gui-tool init [name]`
    > If you would like to use own ExtJS SDK or Siesta version, you can give the folder path of them with optional flags:
      <br/>`--siesta <siesta_path> --extjs <extjs_path>`
    
 
 3. If everything is created successfully, you need to see the following hierarchy.
    ```python
     <project_name>
     |- specification
        |- gui.yml # example specification file
     |- test
        |- siesta # downloaded and extracted Siesta
     |- webui
        |- app
        |- ... # generated Sencha project for ExtJS application
    ```
    
 4. Now you can generate your first ExtJS application generated by gui-tool. Run the following command in project folder:
    
    `gui-tool generate -f`

    > The `-f` or `--force` flag is used for overwriting the existed files in `webui/app`

    If you didn't get any error after generation, you can check the hierarchy looks like the command written in the console. For example the `<project_name>/test` directory should contain new files:
    ```python
     test
     |- gui # new folder
     |- siesta
     |- index.html # new file
  ```
 5. Finally you can test the generated ExtJS application just run the following command:
 
    `gui-tool run`

   > If you would like to open the application in browser in one step, you can use `-o <browser_name>` option. For example with usage of alias: `gui-tool run --open chrome`
   
   > Not only the development version of the application can be started, but the builded version too. With `-p` or `--prod` flags the tool will start the production server as well. And if the `-o` or `--open` flag is also set with the `<browser_name>`, then the development and the production version of the application will be opened in two different tabs.

##**How to specify?**
Gui-tool use an own specifcation schema to describe how the application should look like and what kind of models it has. In `specification` directory the `gui.yml` file is an example specification file. It's used by the application without given other specification file.

Details about the specification schema can be found in [gui-tool Wiki](https://github.com/vartomi/gui-tool/wiki/Specification-schema)

##**Development**
If you need to improve or develop specific functionalitites, UI elements for the generated ExtJS application, you can extend the auto-generated code. It's already a well-formatted and readable source under `webui/app` directory.

See [more](http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/4.2.1/) in ExtJS API document

##**Testing**

Front-end applicaions can not exist without tests. They ensure that the application is working well in most cases. Gui-tool use Bryntum Siesta testing framework, because it's designed and based on ExtJS. With help of it the testing of ExtJS UI elements is very easy.

See [more](http://www.bryntum.com/docs/siesta/#!/api) in Siesta API document
